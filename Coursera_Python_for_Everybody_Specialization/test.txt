As Aristotle put it ¡°Plato is dear to me, but dearer still is truth¡±, children should not be taught to obey their teachers blindly.
However, Chinese parents regard self-discipline as the most important thing to their children, and they fail to teach their children to have adequate self-esteem. As a research points out, 90 percent of the students in elementary and secondary education didn¡¯t question their teachers in class even they are taught something wrong obviously. Some students even dare not to tell their parents when they were abused by their teachers, as a result of the self-discipline of obeying teachers without condition.
From my point of view, children should have more self-esteem in elementary and secondary education, which means they should bear in their mind that teachers are not always right, and they should refuse to do what is not right even it is an order from the teacher. On the other hand, great scientists always have encourage to point out the fault of their teachers. It proves that having self-esteem to against teachers in academic is also of great importance to children¡¯s future growth, while children who believe everything teachers teach is right may lose their ability of critical thinking.
In conclusion, children should be self-discipline and obey teachers, however, having self-esteem is more important. Choosing self-esteem as the main approach of education, and we will find the children become healthier and more creative.
